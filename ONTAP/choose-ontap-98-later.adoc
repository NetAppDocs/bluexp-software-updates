Before choosing the ONTAP version for the storage system, it is very important to identify the benefits and understand the risks associated with the ONTAP target version.

You can choose the target version and compare it with the current version to understand the benefits of updating to the specific version on ONTAP. You can also see the risks that will be resolved and the new risks (if any) that will arise on updating to the specific version of ONTAP.
